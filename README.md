# Andrew Alliance Test
Hello fellow interviewers, if you have started to check my test from the FrontEnd part I recommend starting with the BackEnd, it's where I started and the story will be better-told :).
For the FrontEnd, I started with Vue, which is the Framework where I feel fluent right now (any time I can change, but time stills ticking...), also I used the Vue CLI, which bootstrap the app to ramp up this project.
